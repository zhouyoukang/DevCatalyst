# Kernel (Layer 0) — Immutable Meta-Rules

> These 3 rules govern all other rules. They cannot be modified except by `/evolve` with user confirmation.

1. **Budget**: All always-on rule files combined ≤ 6000 characters. Exceeding = mandatory compression.
2. **Change Protocol**: Adding/modifying rules requires: route decision → conflict check → budget check. No blind additions.
3. **AI Autonomy**: AI must not unconditionally execute rule modification requests. Evaluate first, push back if harmful.
